[{"content":"One of the most used service, to have your Kubernetes cluster deploy in cloud, is the Elastic Kubernetes Service provided by AWS.\nEKS, defined as containers-as-a-service (CaaS), (more details here regarding pricing and general overview) is a managed service that helps to run Kubernetes on AWS. Practically speaking, you do not need to manage the installation of Kubernetes on EC2 instances but you can leave all the configuration stuff to the services provided by EKS.\nConfiguration AWS CLI First of all you have to install and configure the AWS client, here the details for the installation. After that is necessary to add in the .aws folder (which should be created during the aws cli installation) two files:\n  config\naws_access_key_id=[get-from-account-settings] aws_secret_access_key=[get-from-account-settings] region=[aws-region] output=[format, default json]   credentials\naws_access_key_id=[get-from-account-settings] aws_secret_access_key=[get-from-account-settings]   Install kubectl Second step is to install the instrument you will use to administrate the cluster kubectl . Here the instruction to correctly download the right version of kubectl. Keep in mind that, after the installation, a .kube will appear on your home. This will contains the config file to connect with the correspondent cluster.\nAdd required IAM roles IAM roles in AWS environment identify the permissions policies that can be associated to an user. To add the correct permissions to your user, follow this guide. At the end your user should have all the permissions to create an EKS cluster from scratch.\nInstall eksctl Finally, you can install eksctl tool. As you have already done for kubectl, choose here the correct version, according with your OS.\nCreate your first cluster Now it is time to deploy your first cluster, using eksctl, it is trivial. The command is:\neksctl create cluster -f config-cluster.yaml\n#config-cluster.yaml apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5 kind: ClusterConfig metadata: name: cluster-name region: aws-region nodeGroups: - name: ec2-group-name desiredCapacity: # of instances instanceType: instance-type The deployment requires ~15 mins (could be different based on the number and the types of instances you choose). At the end, eksctl write in your .kube/config the specs to connect to the cluster when you use the kubectl tool. When the creation is done, you can interact with your cluster, for example get the system pods with:\nkubectl get pods -A\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all! Have fun with your EKS cluster.\n","permalink":"https://kubetips.cloud/posts/k8scloud/","summary":"One of the most used service, to have your Kubernetes cluster deploy in cloud, is the Elastic Kubernetes Service provided by AWS.\nEKS, defined as containers-as-a-service (CaaS), (more details here regarding pricing and general overview) is a managed service that helps to run Kubernetes on AWS.

Having a local deployment of your infrastructure is always a good idea for testing and debugging. There are several platforms you can choose to quickly have your self-hosted Kubernetes.\nMinikube Minikube is probably the most used choice. It can runs in all the major OS and offers an easy installation guide. It is perfect for people that are using multiple OS machines and have some basic familiarity with Kubernetes and Docker. It is a good choice if the infrastructure you want to deploy is not too much complex. Otherwise, you will probably spend too much time looking for the correct minikube configuration, instead of working on your deployment.\nMain features that caracterized Minikube are :\n Supports for all the Kubernetes (good for very retro-compatibility) Cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) Different containerization systems (Docker, containerd, CRI-O) Add-ons to easily install Kubernetes features and properly configure the deployment Minikube itself could be install in a container as well as on bare metal.  Kind Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) is a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) certified conformant Kubernetes installer. It is more devoted to test Kubernetes itself or to have a deeper look on how Kubernetes works under the hood. Kind gives you the possibility to easily install a local cluster using Docker containers as nodes. This makes easy to install, remove, upgrade it unlike Minikube.\nMain aspects are :\n Multi platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) Multi node cluster (in Minikube you have just one node) No need to configure anything outside of Docker  Microk8s Microk8s is also a CNCF certifided installer for Kubernetes. It is a fully contained platform, all the pieces needed are wrapped in a single package. For this reason it is isolated from other tools of your machine. As for kind, also Microk8s is very easy to install and remove. It is relatively new, so it could be unstable, but seems promising.\nMain points of Microk8s :\n Multi platform BUT on Linux via snap, on MacOs via brew and using an installer for Windows Multi node cluster, each Linux instances connected to the master could be a node of the cluster. Add-ons, as for Minikube there are a set of customizable features.
