      <description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Marco Franzon and this is KubeTips.
I would like to have a place in which share what I find interesting and curious using frequently Docker and Kubernetes. As I spend mostly of my time writing Python code and doing DevOps stuff with containers, everyday I face out new bugs or challenges to solve, sometimes it is fun sometimes it is frustrating, but always I learn something new.</description>
